        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        </p><p>
          <h4>What's it like to be an LDS student at Harvard?</h4>
        </p><p>
          Harvard is a great place to be a Latter-day Saint! Harvard has a
          long tradition of having Mormons on its campus; many great members
          of the church have studied and/or taught here, including John A.
          Widstoe, Kim Clark, Robert D. Hales, and Henry B. Eyring. It is a
          fantastic place to build and strengthen a testimony and get a
          world-class education. The administration and other Harvard students
          are very respectful of LDS students' standards. Most Harvard students
          and faculty already have had LDS acquaintances, co-workers, and
          friends here on campus. If you stick to who you are, you will thrive
          here.
        </p><p>
        <h4>How many LDS undergraduates are there at Harvard?</h4>
        </p><p>
Harvard averages between 30-45
 LDS undergraduates. This year we welcomed nine LDS freshmen from all over
 the U.S. We're excited to have them! It is always a diverse group supportive
 of one another. There are also many Mormon students at Harvard’s graduate
 schools.
        </p><p>
        <h4>Where do LDS Harvard students attend church?</h4>
        </p><p>
 Undergraduates attend the Cambridge University Ward -- made up of about 150
 undergrads from MIT, Tufts, Boston University, Boston College, New England
 Conservatory, and other area schools. The meetinghouse is less than a ten
 minute walk from Harvard Yard. There are three singles wards that meet at
 that chapel, attracting singles from all over the greater Boston area.
 The ward holds regular activities, sponsors monthly trips to the Boston
 Temple, and holds weekly family home evening groups, one of which meets at
 Harvard. The ward is exceptionally diverse in terms of peoples background
 and interests, and you will have the support of committed members with strong
 testimonies. Its a great place to meet people, make friends, and find people
 to date.
        </p><p>
        <h4>Are there Institute classes available nearby?</h4>
        </p><p>
Yes. Multiple Institute classes are held on Harvard's campus every week.
 In addition, the Institute teaches a number of other classes at the local
 meetinghouse. The Institute also holds regular activities, dances and service
 projects. Take a look at the our <a href="activities.html">calendar</a> or at
 the
<a href ="https://studentview.ldschurch.org/Home.aspx/Home/60384">home page</a>
 of the Boston Institute of Religion for more information.
        </p><p>
<h4>What kind of activities does the Harvard LDSSA have?</h4>
        </p><p>
The LDSSA sponsors a number of activities every year. We have an annual
 fall ice cream bash, Christmas Fireside, and a winter retreat. We also hold
regular forums featuring some of Harvard's
 LDS faculty, including Pulitzer Prize-winning History Professor Laurel Ulrich
 and Kennedy School Professor Roger Porter. Harvard offers a wealth of
 activities, and LDS students often get together informally to take advantage.
        </p><p>
<h4>What are the LDSSA members like?</h4>
        </p><p>
We're a diverse bunch of guys and girls from all over the U.S. Many of us have
 served missions. Our concentrations (majors) range from Philosophy to
 Neuroscience to Art History to Engineering. Some of us play on sports teams,
 and were all involved in extracurricular activities from orchestras to choirs
 to service organizations. We're really friendly and enjoy getting together for
 good, clean fun.
        </p><p>
<h4>Can I arrange to have an LDS roommate?</h4>
        </p><p>
Freshmen are assigned rooms without regard to religion, but it has
 happened in the past that LDS freshmen have been roommates with each
 other. In any case, Harvard Yard is a cozy environment, so you are never far
 from other LDS students. After freshman year, students may choose their
 roommates. It is very common that LDS students room together sophomore to
senior years.
        </p><p>
<h4>What do I do if I want to serve a mission?</h4>
        </p><p>
Harvard is great about helping students who want to serve missions before
 they've graduated. Students desiring to serve missions simply inform their
 Freshman Dean (if leaving after their freshman year) or Senior Tutor
 (if later) of their decision and arrange for a leave of absence. Altogether,
 it takes about thirty minutes to make the necessary arrangements to go on a
 mission (and less paperwork than dropping a class!). Returning to Harvard
 after a mission is equally easy. Students are assigned to upper-class houses
 near the end of freshman year and usually submit housing preferences to those
 houses that will be honored when the student returns. There is absolutely no
 stigma associated with taking time off. Many non-Mormon students take time
 off to pursue their own special interests. Most members of the Harvard
 community agree that the time off makes for better students when they get back.
        </p><p>
<h4>How many LDS students are there at Harvard compared to other Ivy League
 schools?</h4>
        </p><p>
From what we understand, Harvard has the most LDS students out
 of all the Ivy League schools. They have great programs too, though!
        </p><p>
<h4>How can I get in touch with you?</h4>
        </p><p>
Email us! Please, we’d love to hear from you and answer your questions.
 Email any of the executive board members listed on the <a href="contact.html">contact page
</a> or send one to our president, Christian Bennett: <a href="mailto:christianbennett@college.harvard.edu">christianbennett@college.harvard.edu</a>.
        </p><p>
<h4>What is the social life like as a Harvard undergrad?</h4>
        </p><p>
Whatever your particular interests, Harvard itself and Boston in general
 offer more they could do in four years time! Harvard students are generally
 very outgoing, and the student body is so diverse that you’ll easily be able
 to find a group of friends. You can always find something to do on the
 weekends. The truth is that Harvard students are often so involved in their
 activities of choice that they spend their weekends doing athletics, music,
 theater, etc. When they have free time, most students at Harvard prefer a
 night at the theater, Fenway Park, just hanging out  or even, maybe, studying.
 Harvard also has a number of really fun campus-wide dances each semester as
 well. Weekends do not have to be expensive.  There are lots of free and
 low-cost events in the area.
        </p><p>
<h4>If I want to visit campus, can I stay with an LDS student?</h4>
        </p><p>
Absolutely! We’d love to have you stay with us! Email us ahead of time, and
 we will arrange it.
        </p><p>
<h4>How can I get a Harvard application?</h4>
        </p><p>
